# Notes

Notes is a small command line tool created for myself to take notes quickly from the terminal while coding. It stores the notes together with the date it was written in a markdown file in the user directory.

Currently it has the following commands:

* --help: See list of commands
* open: Open notes file
* write "note": Write note to file

To use this project right now you probably have to jump through some hoops, but the idea is to build it configurable with regards to file and editor.
