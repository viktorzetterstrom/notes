# Notes

Notes is a small command line tool created for myself to take notes quickly from the terminal while coding. It stores the notes together with the date it was written in a markdown file in the user directory.

Currently it has the following commands:

- help: See list of commands
- open: Open notes file
- write "note": Write note to file
- configure: Configure the application
